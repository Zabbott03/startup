# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

A snake game where you try to eat "food pellets" to grow longer, while trying to not hit yourself, the walls, or other players.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

Everybody has played the classic __Snake game__, where you try to grow your snake without bumping into your ever growing tail. The one thing that would make the game better is if you could play with your friends! With this app, you will be able to compete against your friends in real time! You will battle to be the longest, or you can try to take them out by having them run into you. Your scores will go onto a leaderboard with all of your friends, allowing your high score and win to be remembered, showing everyone who the best snake player is.

### Design

This is a (very) rough sketch of what the game page and the leaderboard page will look like.


### Key features

- create an account with a secure login
- ability to join a game with up to three other people
- ability to see high scores of yourself and others
- ability to change the color of your snake
- able to interact with other players with your snake as you play
- in-game counter with the score of all players
- host can start and end game

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Used for the base structure of the app. Login page, leaderboard page, as well as the main game page
- **CSS** - Will be used to style the three pages. Will include visually pleasing color choice as well as proper spacing depending on the device screen size.
- **React** - Will be used to control the game and login and create an account. Also used to start and end the game, as well as add more players. 
- **Service** - Used to login and to retrieve position of each player's snake.
- **DB/Login** - Will have the high score of each user in the database, displayed in the leaderboard. Also used to store the account info for each person after creating an account.
- **WebSocket** - Position of all snakes will be broadcast to each other player in real time.
